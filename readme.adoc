= choose_workflo

== Purpose

choose_workflo replaces https://github.com/Nzen/JarLauncher[JarLauncher] as my preferred means of starting our binaries at work. However, this comes at the cost of being very, very specific to our contemporary folder structure.

== License

choose_workflo is released under the terms of the Eclipse Public license v2 or later.

== Run

`java -jar choose-workflo-2.0.jar`

If it finds a valid config.eno file next to the jar, it uses the values therein.
